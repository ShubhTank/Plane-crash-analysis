The project leverages a curated dataset of historical plane crashes to extract insights about aviation safety, trends over time, geographic hotspots, and crash causes. Using Tableau, the analysis transforms raw data into interactive dashboards that help viewers understand how and why aviation accidents occur.

The Tableau workbook (Plane Crash analysis.twb) visualizes the data through:

Time-series analysis of crash frequency

Fatality counts and survival rates

Geographic mapping of crash locations

Cause-based filtering and severity analysis

This project is useful for aviation researchers, data enthusiasts, and anyone interested in exploring aviation safety through data visualization.
